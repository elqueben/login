## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to authenticate a user and grant them access to a secure area of a website. It verifies the user's identity by comparing their login credentials (such as email and password) against a database of authorized users.

## Functionality
When a user navigates to the Login Page, they are typically prompted to enter their login credentials. These credentials are then transmitted securely to the server for verification. If the credentials are correct, the server grants the user access to the secured area of the website or application. If the credentials are incorrect, the user will be denied access and prompted to try again or reset their password.

A typical Login Page may include the following components:

**Username/Email and Password Fields:** This is where the user enters their login credentials.
**"Remember Me" Checkbox:** This allows the user to remain logged in for a specified period of time.
**"Forgot Password" Link:** This allows the user to reset their password if they have forgotten it.
**"Sign Up" Link:** This allows new users to create an account and access the secure area.
